# Shell Script Memory Efficiency Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in shell scripts when handling large files: inefficient memory usage.  The provided `bug.sh` script attempts to process a large file line by line, but it loads the entire file into memory, leading to potential crashes or significant performance degradation on very large input files.  The solution (`bugSolution.sh`) demonstrates a more memory-efficient approach using `xargs`.

## Bug Description
The `bug.sh` script uses a `while` loop to read the input file line by line.  This approach, while simple, is inefficient for large files as it loads the entire file into memory.  For extremely large files, this can result in the script failing due to insufficient memory.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.sh` script provides a more efficient alternative.  It leverages the `xargs` command to process the file in chunks, significantly reducing memory consumption.  `xargs` reads the input file and executes a command (in this case, a short script) for each chunk or line, minimizing the memory footprint.

## How to Reproduce
1. Create a large text file (e.g., `large_file.txt`)
2. Run `bug.sh` (you will likely observe slow processing or a memory error on very large files).
3. Run `bugSolution.sh` (you should observe improved performance and reduced memory usage).
